# Rideshare Email Server

A simple email server using express and nodemailer. I created this for my rideshare project found at https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/rideshare because emailjs only had 200 free emails. I'm  using https://www.sendinblue.com/ as my smtp server. It also takes advantage of my cors-anywhere proxy to use it from rideshare.
